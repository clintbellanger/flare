# The loot_type is a list of strings, which describe which kind of loot
# is being dropped. The strings should match the "loot" entry in the item
# database. Optionally a number can be passed after each string entry to
# adapt the probablity of the entry. If the optional probability number
# is omited, 1 is assumed.

# The following configuration has a sum of all weights of 5+1+4=10, so
# the distribution is steps of 10 percents.
# Gold will be dropped in 50 percent of the cases. In 10 percent there
# will be clothes and in the other remaining 40 percent a dagger will be dropped.
