him=I am Guill, a scribe with the Order. I am grateful you've come -- we are short on trained warriors due to the call-to-arms in Ancelot. What the locals call the Goblin Warrens is actually the entrance to a grand underground fortress known as Averguard Keep. This site is sacred to our order. Our primary mission is to cleanse the evil from this place.

[dialog]
requires_status=ak_intro
set_status=ak_ukkonen_search
him=The goblins in the Warrens answer to a warlord named Ukkonen. Most goblins are merely curious; this Ukkonen is bloodthirsty. Punish him for desecrating this place. His lair is here in the Warrens, northwest of our location.

[dialog]

requires_not=ak_tome_found
him=The Averguard left a set of Chronicles detailing their final era. One volume is missing. I've searched this entire area except for Ukkonen's lair. If you find the book please return to me.

him=You found this tome in Ukkonen's lair? Most excellent -- I feared this volume was lost. With it we can piece together the true history of this keep. I just need a moment to study...

[dialog]

set_status=ak_key_search
him=This tome confirms what we know of Averguard Keep -- it crumbled against the plague many centuries ago. But not all of the infected were destroyed. It appears many undead where locked away in hopes that a cure would be found. Head northwest into the Atrium, then southeast to the Prison. Search for a key to access the sealed areas of the Keep.

set_status=ak_temple_search
him=There is one place within the Keep that no living being has seen for centuries: the burial chamber behind Averguard Temple. From the Atrium, head north to access the Temple. Use your key to enter the Burial Chamber. Show utmost respect -- the powerful leader of the Averguard is buried there.

#You insert the Averguard Key. Runes glow around the door, then fade. The door is still sealed.

[dialog]
requires_status=ak_temple_sealed
set_status=ak_talisman_search
him=So the Burial Chamber is still locked? It must be sealed by powerful magic. There was only one sorceror of Averguard with that kind of power - Professor Langlier. Search through his collection to find a way into the Burial Chamber. Go south from the Atrium to enter his Academy.  I must admit jealousy -- I have dreamed many years of seeing the old volumes there, but it is simply too dangerous yet.

him=Fate has delivered this talisman to you. With it and the Averguard Key, you have the ability to open the Burial Chamber. Read these runes aloud at the sealed door and the path will be opened.

[dialog]
requires_status=ak_talisman_reward
him=My worst fear is come alive. Just as with the Warden and with Professor Langlier, Sir Evan Maddox himself was inflicted with undeath. If we are to reclaim the Keep, you must defeat him. The Order will reward you magnificently for this service. But be prepared -- not even undeath will limit Maddox's zeal. Enter the Burial Chamber and allow him redemption.

[dialog]

him=It is still dangerous here, but with Maddox defeated his followers will soon find rest.
