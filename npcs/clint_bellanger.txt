him=Welcome to the dungeon, and to an alpha test of Flare. You're playing a very early work in progress. (to continue talking to me, hit spacebar or enter)
him=In a completed game there would be an intro area with training, well before you go dungeon diving. No such luxury yet. But level 1 is too weak, so I'll give you a boost...
reward_xp=20
set_status=trained
him=There, I've granted you enough experience points (XP) to reach level 2. Now you can increase one of your core Attributes:
him=The four attributes in Flare are Physical, Mental, Offense, and Defense. Physical represents bodily toughness and melee combat. Mental represents intelligence and affinity for magic. Offense represents combat precision and ranged weapons such as bows. Defense represents avoiding damage and proper armor use.
him=You can increase one attribute now through the Character (C) menu.
